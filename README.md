# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Welcome to the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project — a practical, data-driven approach to identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. This repository contains a working Jupyter notebook demonstrating the full pipeline from data exploration to model evaluation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a growing challenge impacting financial institutions and consumers worldwide. This project aims to build a robust detection system that can spot fraudulent patterns early, helping mitigate losses and protect users.

The current version leverages a real-world dataset, exploring preprocessing techniques, handling class imbalance, and training classification models to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
